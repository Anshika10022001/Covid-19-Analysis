# Covid-19 Analysis India

A Data Analysis Project which depicts the conditon of Covid-19 across Indian States

## Analysis Framework

- Data Extraction: The first step involved extracting data from a JSON format using the 'requests' library in Python. This library provides an easy way to send HTTP/1.1 requests using Python.

- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Once the data was extracted, it was necessary to clean and prepare it for analysis. This step involved removing any inconsistencies or errors in the data, as well as formatting it in a way that made it suitable for analysis.

- Data Aggregation using MySQL: After the data was cleaned and prepared, it was imported into a MySQL database for analysis. This involved performing various aggregations and calculations on the data to generate insights.

- Dashboard Creation in Excel: Once the data was analyzed, the insights were visualized in a dashboard using Microsoft Excel. This involved creating graphs, charts, and tables that represented the insights generated from the data.

### The Dashboard:

- PowerPoint Presentation: Finally, the insights from the dashboard were summarized and presented in a PowerPoint presentation. This involved creating slides that highlighted the most important findings from the data analysis, as well as providing context and explanations for the insights.

## Lessons Learned

- Always plan ahead: Planning ahead and creating a roadmap of the different activities that need to be completed can help keep the project on track and ensure that all the necessary steps are completed in a timely and efficient manner.

- Data cleaning is essential: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis is a critical step in any data project, as it ensures that the insights are based on accurate and reliable data.

- The importance of visualization: Creating visualizations of the data can help communicate insights to stakeholders and make them more engaging and understandable.

- The power of automation: Using tools and scripts to automate repetitive or time-consuming tasks can save a significant amount of time and effort, allowing more focus on the actual analysis and insights.

- The value of collaboration: Collaborating with others can provide different perspectives, ideas, and insights, ultimately leading to a better end result.

- Continuous learning: Technology and tools are constantly evolving, and keeping up to date with the latest developments can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of future projects.
